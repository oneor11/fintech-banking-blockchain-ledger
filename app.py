# Step 3:
# Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

# Code additional input areas for the user interface of your Streamlit
# application. Create these input areas to capture the sender, receiver, and
# amount for each transaction that youâ€™ll store in the `Block` record.
# To do so, complete the following steps:
# 1. Delete the `input_data` variable from the Streamlit interface.
# 2. Add an input area where you can get a value for `sender` from the user.
# 3. Add an input area where you can get a value for `receiver` from the user.
# 4. Add an input area where you can get a value for `amount` from the user.
# 5. As part of the Add Block button functionality, update `new_block` so that `Block` consists of an attribute named `record`, which is set equal to a `Record` that contains the `sender`, `receiver`, and `amount` values. The updated `Block`should also include the attributes for `creator_id` and `prev_hash`.

# Delete the `input_data` variable from the Streamlit interface.

# Step 4:
# Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records

# Test your complete `PyChain` ledger and user interface by running your
# Streamlit application and storing some mined blocks in your `PyChain` ledger.
# Then test the blockchain validation process by using your `PyChain` ledger.
# To do so, complete the following steps:

# 1. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where you've coded the
#  Challenge.

# 2. In the terminal, run the Streamlit application by
# using `streamlit run pychain.py`.

# 3. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the "Add
# Block" button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger.

# 4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu.
# Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should detail a
# blockchain that consists of multiple blocks. Include the screenshot in the
# `README.md` file for your Challenge repository.

# 5. Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface.
# Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should indicate
# the validity of the blockchain. Include the screenshot in the `README.md`
# file for your Challenge repository.
